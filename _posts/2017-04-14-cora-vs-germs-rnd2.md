So we went to the doctor and Coraâ€™s mouth was swabbed for lab test and the result shows she had Rhinovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)

She is recovering quite well now,but she still doesnt have much energy to walk and most of the time after few steps, she lost balance and stumble. But day by day, we can see that she is gaining her energy back, starting to eat and drink well, cant sit still and just wants to keep moving.

Even when adult gets sick, the best medicine is still plenty of fluid and rest!!!
