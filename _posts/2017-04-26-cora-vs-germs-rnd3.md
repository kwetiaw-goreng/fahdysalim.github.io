title: Cora VS Germs - Round 3
---

HMFD aka Hand and Mouth Disease, normally caused by group of enteroviruses, most commonly the Coxsackie virus. There’s a recent outbreak in Southwest part of Sydney

And guess what! Yes Cora got it too. YAY for mom and dad!

She was happy chappy earlier in the day and just before dinner time we felt that her body temperature was rising and we thought because she had a full fun day. But little did we know, the virus was already in her and incubating (3-4 days)! We noticed an ulcer on a tip of her tongue which was hurting her when eating and breastfeeding.

We decided to see a doctor because she couldnt sleep peacefully which means we all couldn’t sleep peacefully. The doctor confirmed it most likely to be HMFD and we need to be prepared for the worst. Uggh… go google HMFD and see all that images. yikes!

The doctor prescribed SM33 Gel that supposed to numb the pain as well as paracetamol for kids. Tonight, she was eating quite well, not as well as the usual but enough to make us feel good. She seems to be resting quite well too right now. The pro tip I keep hearing as a new parent, sleep when the baby sleep, I think I might just do that now.

Peace!
