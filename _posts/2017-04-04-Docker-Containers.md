***Containers! Containers! Containers!***

***Why bother using containers? In my experience with them:***
1. They are easy to set up these days, few lines and you have a service running.
2. I don’t really have much time these days, cant argue with a demanding toddler. So having something to work almost immediately without having to worry about dependencies, is so much preferred!
3. Secure and they don’t take lots of resources, these containers talk directly to the host resources. One of my old computer (Intel i3, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD) is currently running 20+ containers

Most of my services at home are running on containers across few servers (HP Proliant Microserver Gen8 & N40L and few Raspberry Pis)
Before Docker, I used to run multiple services such as NGINX with Lets Encrypt, Transmission, OwnCloud, Wallabag, Homessistant under one operating system. I can tell you that it was not fun (fun for a while as you get to learn along the way), hours spent to install the services and its dependencies manually, following different guides scattered all over the Internet.

Docker is staying in my homelab for a long time!
