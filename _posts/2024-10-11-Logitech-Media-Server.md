title: Logitech Media Server is Still the King
---

Although Logitech has dropped its support, it is still continued to be maintained by the community. It's simply the best out there and these days it's known as Lyrion Media Server
  
I still have 4-5 Logitech Boomboxes spread around the house, I still prefer to use this over the Sonos system.

Long live the King.
