I found a Panasonic Amp/Player with 1 pair of speaker in my apartment's recycling room the other day. Brought it in and tested, all is working fine. Without going to the topic of how this society has becoming increasingly a 'throw away' society.

I was pondering what to do with it, I can still play CDs if I have any around. There's DAB but it's missing the antenna. I dont have old iPhone laying around, thankfully my LG V30 has 3.5mm headphone jack, DAC capable too! So I tested it and it sounds pretty good, definitely better than your typical bluetooth speaker.

I then remember that I have tried using MPD many years ago and I too remember when NTC was still around that I read in their project/idea blog that they turned CHIP into MPD server and bluetooth speaker. So I dusted off CHIP and got to work. 

I'm glad there are still individual and reddit community that are keeping this device alive! thanks you!

So I followed this guide to install MPD server and I connect it to my NAS where I keep all my music.

For bluetooth speaker, I followed this guide 

It works and sounds great too!
