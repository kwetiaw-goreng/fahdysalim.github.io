My wife often has to go to work on the weekend, leaving me with a 16 months old toddler. First time I had to do this, it freaked the hell out of me, when is meal time, what happened if she wants mumma's milk, who goes to shower first? me or her? and so on. However, overtime I become quite good at it. Few extra skills also acquired along the way.

**How about a yummy pancake?**
