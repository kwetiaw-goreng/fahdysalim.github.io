Title: "Practicing SSO SAML Integration with Azure for Free"
---

Ever wondered how to learn to integrate SSO to Enterprise Application in Azure? For Free?
I have discovered that you can use this 2 apps to practice
1. Salesforce (Free Dev Account and Free SSO)
2. Atlassian Cloud (Free Dev Account but need to sign up to Atlassian Access Free for 30 days trial)

MS Docs has full documentation on how to enable SSO to Salesforce and Atlassian Cloud.

Have fun!
