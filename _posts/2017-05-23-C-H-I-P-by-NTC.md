title: C.H.I.P Single Board Computer
---

I recently purchased this $9 (more like AUD$14) Single Board Computers (SBC) by Next Thing Co, and I have turned one of them into ad blocking device Pi-Hole for my home network. 
It works really well and I leave it running 24Ã—7 because it barely consume electricity.Pi-hole can be run on different operating system and hardware. 
It can be run on Docker if you dont have linux server or SBC like C.H.I.P or Raspberry Pi.

***Kiss those annoying Ads goodbye!***
